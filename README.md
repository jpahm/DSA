# DSA [![.NET](https://github.com/jpahm/DSA/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jpahm/DSA/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

This repository simply serves as a collection of well-tested C# implementations of some common data structures and algorithms that I've put together **for practice and educational purposes.**

You are free to use the contents of this project as you wish. Note that most of these are not as optimized as their native .NET variants due to lacking hardware-specific optimizations and direct CLR access. **PRs will not be accepted unless they fix bugs in existing implementations**, as allowing others to do the work for me would defeat the purpose of this project.

#### CURRENTLY WIP!

## Usage
This project compiles as a shared library which can then be used in other applications; it cannot be executed directly.

## Data Structures:
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque (double-ended queue)
- Circular Queue
- Linked List
- Hash table (using multiplicative hashing and chaining)
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree (self-balancing BST)

## Algorithms:
- TBD
